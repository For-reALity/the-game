# Welcome!

Welcome to The Game! This is an open source project for students in IT 115. The goal of the project is to make a bunch of web application code so we can all practice
managing this code on GitHub. 

## Environment Details

Part of the class is to explore different development enviroments. This repository will be for code contributions from all class members. The class is divided into groups.
There is a directory for group. Each student should only contribute code to the directory for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access
to the entire repository, but please be responsibe and put your code in your assigned directory!

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

## Testing

You can test the latest version of The Game at this URL:

http://the-game-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

At the top of the structure will be:

index.html
error.html
README.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
LICENSE
At the next level will be directories for each group and for the lead author (bob):

group1
group2
group3
group4
bob
Index.html will point to one landing page in each group's directory:

group1 > front.html
group2 > back.html
group3 > right.html
group4 > left.html
bob > cave.html
Be sure to keep your group's content in it's own folder!

Also be sure to fix any broken links in your group's folder!

Any stray files or directories left at the top level will be deleted.
