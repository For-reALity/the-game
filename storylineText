## Storyline for our wild-west game - Left Room. 
## You enter the hot, dusty, room, squinting to see:  horses, taxidermy 
## animal heads, and cowboy hats.
## You realize that you have several choices for each of these items.

## You may pick your horses color: left arrow for "calico", up arrow for "snowy white", and right arrow "blackish grey."

## You then somehow find yourself staring out across a canyon sitting atop your hourse, somewhere in a desert which must be the South Western United States.
## You have three options which you can move:


## Type "Left": You continue on your horse towards a forested mountain range with a human establishment visible in the distance.

## Type "Right": You turn right and follow a road with a sign next to it saying your are 5 miles from a town named Deepwell.

## Type "Forward": You traverse down the steep canyon you are overlooking, horse by your side, one perilous shuffle of foot movements at a time. You will follow a 
## narrow, winding river that cuts through the treachorous canyon. This canyon leads through a meadow which subsequently leads to a dark forest, the Black Forest.
## Left: The trail leading to the small town in the mountain range is an easygoing trot atop your reliable 4-hooved mode of transportation. You travel through 
## meadows filled with wild flowers, and small shrubs. You arrive at the base of the mountain and a dark forest appears. 
## Type "Back" to return to the left room.
## Back - you end up in the left room staring once again.
## Type "Forward" to continue into the forest. 
## Forward: The Black Forest is filled with twisted trees and birds making eerie calls as if they are stuck in a place they cannot escape.Continuing through 
## the forest you come across a cabin with an earthen roof with plants and small shrubs growing atop it.
## Type "Knock" to knock on the door of this oddly-built hut.
## Type "Keep Going" to continue through the Black Forest.
## Knock - you dismount your horse and knock on the sturdy oak door. A small creature appears, a dwarf. It asks you who you are and what might it help you with.
## Keep Going - you continue through the Black Forest towards the town of Seldomton. You arrive at Seldomton and realize you don't have a cowboy hat. Everyone
## you see in town has a cowboy hat. You enter a supply store and see three options to choose from:
  ## Type "white" for White Leather.
  ## Type "black" for Black Felt.
  ## Type "brown" for Brown Straw.
## Type "Help" to ask the dwarf what lies beyond the Black Forest in particular the town you spotted from a distance.
## Type "Map" to inquire whether the dwarf has a map you can have or if he can make you one.
## Help - the dwarf informs you that you are travelling through the notorious Black Forest, known for hundreds of years for being a refuge for displaced members
## of society; witches, cast-away warriors, thieves and murderers. He intstucts you to not stop except to give your horse food and water and continue to the town
## which the dwarf calls "Seldomtown."
## Map - You ask the dwarf for a map in hopes of finding what is beyond the town. The dwarf gives you a detailed map of the whole area and shows you where a cave
## is which contains riches and ancient artifacts. You travel through the Black Forest as hastily as possible and arrive at the left room. You enter the dusty town 
## and the first thing you see are three animal heads mounted on a wall. You have a feeling that there is something behind each of these taxidermies and you begin to 
## explore the hidden items. You feel compelled to look behind each of these heads.
## Type "Boar" to remove the boar's head and find a leather bag of crystal diamonds.
## Type "Bear" to remove the bear's head and discover a satchel of red rubies.
## Type "Elk" to remove the elk's head and uncover another leather bag, this time containing gold coins.
