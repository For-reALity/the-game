# the-wild-west-game
Project repository for IT 115 Winter 2021

Four students from IT 115 are going to add content to this project, focusing on our game idea -- the Wild West. 

The Game itself does not really have to do very much. It's mostly just an excuse to make several directories of practice code we can practice managing projects on GitHub.
That being said, if you can add some fun features to the Game, please do!

To get started with this project, you have to sign up for IT 115. Then you will be assigned to a group. Your group will contribute code to this class-level repository. 

Users can get help with this project by posting on this technical discussion board:

Joe is the primary editor for this class-level repository for the game. All group members are invited to collaborate.
